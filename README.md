🏠 Airbnb Clone Project

Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on backend development, database design, API creation, and security implementation while mirroring real-world team collaboration.

Project Goals

- Develop a scalable backend architecture.
- Understand team-based software development using GitHub.
- Design and implement a relational database with MySQL.
- Build secure APIs and integrate them with frontend components.
- Apply CI/CD best practices for automated deployment.


Tech Stack

- Backend Framework: Django
- Database: MySQL
- API Development: GraphQL / REST
- Containerization & Deployment: Docker, GitHub Actions
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

### Team Roles

This project follows common software development team roles to ensure clear responsibilities and efficient collaboration. The descriptions below combine the roles mentioned in the project overview with standard responsibilities from industry best practices.

### Product Owner
Defines product vision and priorities, collects stakeholder requirements, and approves major deliverables. Acts as the main point of contact for product decisions and feature prioritization.

### Project Manager / Scrum Master
Coordinates schedules, milestones, and team communication. Ensures the team follows agreed processes (e.g., Scrum), removes blockers, and tracks progress against delivery goals.

### Business Analyst (BA)
Gathers and documents business requirements, translates stakeholder needs into detailed functional requirements and user stories, and helps validate solutions against business goals.

### Software Architect
Designs the overall system architecture, defines high-level components and their interactions, selects core technologies and patterns, and ensures scalability, maintainability, and security of the design.

### Backend Developer
Implements server-side logic, builds APIs (REST/GraphQL), enforces business rules, integrates with the database and external services, and writes automated tests for backend functionality.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the relational database (MySQL), defines schemas and relationships, optimizes queries and indexes, ensures backups, and maintains data integrity and security.

### DevOps / CI-CD Engineer
Configures infrastructure-as-code, containerization (Docker), and CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions). Responsible for automated builds, deployments, environment provisioning, and monitoring.

### QA Engineer / Test Engineer
Designs and runs manual and automated tests to validate functionality, performance, and security. Creates test plans, reports bugs, and verifies fixes to ensure release quality.

### UI/UX Designer (if included)
Designs user flows, wireframes, and visual mocks to ensure the product is usable and accessible. Works closely with frontend and product to translate designs into implementable components.

### Security Engineer (or Security-conscious DevOps)
Defines and enforces API security measures (authentication, authorization, input validation, secure storage of secrets), performs threat modeling, and guides secure coding best practices.
